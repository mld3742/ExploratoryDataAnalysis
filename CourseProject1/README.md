## Course Project 1

#### Instructions

This assignment uses data from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

<ul>
<li> <b>Dataset:</b> <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]  </li>
<li> <b>Description:</b> Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.</li>
</ul>


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI web site:</a>

<ol type="1">
<li><b>Date:</b> Date in formation dd/mm/yyyy</li>
<li><b>Time:</b> time in format hh:mm:ss</li>
<li><b>Global_active_power:</b> household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)</li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power:</b> household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)</li>
<li><b>Voltage</b> minute-averaged voltage (in volt)</li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b> household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)</li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b> energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).</li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b> energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.</li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>  energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>


There are 8 files that are of importance here: 4 R code files and 4 PNG files.  These are the files that were used to replicate the plots shown in the repository: <a href="https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1>https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1</a>

The four plots that I have created are shown below:
